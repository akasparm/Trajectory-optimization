# Trajectory Optimization:

###	1. Guidelines for running the code:
		1.1 The program requires the following libraries: matplotlib
		
###	2. Input:
		2.1 The program does not require any input
	
###	3. Output:
		3.1 The program iterates the values of Ψ, Θ, Φ, ωx, ωy, ωz for the time zero to t(shortest), and plots the graphs.
